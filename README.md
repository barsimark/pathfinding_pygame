# Shortest path algorithm visulizer
This project was created to visulaize the most popular shortest path algorithms.

## Implemented algorithms
 * BFS
 * Dijkstra's algorithm
 * A star search
 * Bidirectional BFS

## How to use
The grid is considered to be the base of the algorithms.

Press:
 * 1: BFS algorithm
 * 2: Dijkstra's algorithm
 * 3: A star search
 * 4: Bidirectional BFS
 * N: clear previous route
 * Del: clear all
 
Click on a tile to make it blocked (gray) or unblocked (white). The first ones cannot be part of any route.

During the simulation the found tiles are colored with blue. The optimal route can be seen as yellow at the end of the simulation.

## Technologies
The project was created with:
 * Python 3
 * Pygame library
